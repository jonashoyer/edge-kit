Break down the feature into small, concrete tasks, such as "Set up basic React component structure" or "Implement API endpoint for user data," as this makes progress more measurable. Start each task description with an action verb and include specific acceptance criteria or technical details that will remind your future self exactly what needs to be done, like "Create PostgreSQL table for user preferences with columns: user_id, theme_preference, notification_settings." Keep a simple prioritized list in a tool you'll actually use (even a basic text file works), and include any technical dependencies or notes that will help you resume work efficiently after interruptions, such as "Requires completion of authentication middleware before starting."
