# Edge Kit

Edge Kit is a carefully designed TypeScript toolkit for modern serverless applications, with a special emphasis on NextJS and similar platforms. It includes a set of high-quality, type-safe components that can be copied and reused as desired.

## Core Philosophy

- **Copy-Paste Architecture**: Each component is self-contained and can be copied directly into your project
- **Type-First Design**: Built with TypeScript's advanced type system for maximum safety and developer experience
- **Edge Computing Ready**: Optimized for serverless and edge computing environments
- **Modular & Flexible**: Use only what you need, no unnecessary dependencies

## Implementation

The codebase follows these key principles:

1. **Abstract Base Classes**: Services implement abstract classes for consistent interfaces
2. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of generics and advanced TypeScript features
3. **Error Handling**: Custom error types and proper error propagation
4. **Testing Friendly**: Code structured for easy unit testing
5. **Edge Compatible**: No dependencies on Node.js-specific features

## Usage

1. Browse the source code in the repository
2. Copy the needed components into your project
3. Import and use with full type safety

## Best For

- NextJS applications
- Serverless functions
- Edge computing environments
- Type-safe applications
- Microservices architectures
