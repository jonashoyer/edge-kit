Requirements for AI/LLM prompts:

- Use clear, direct language.
- Keep prompts specific, unambiguous, and well-structured.
- Break down ambiguous or complex tasks into logical subtasks for easier execution.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or verbosity.

If a prompt fails to meet these standards:

- Identify deficiencies. (e.g., "poor structure", "ambiguous goal", etc.)
- Propose improved drafts for clarity.

Note:

- Zod schemas for AI/LLM responses convert to JSON schema at runtime.
- Lines starting with "% " are comments and excluded from the final prompt.
