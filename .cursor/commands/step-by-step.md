Before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state of the codebasr. Describe what existing code you will be using, what you will need, which files are relevent, and anything else a programmer might need to work on this project. Do not include any assumptions or theories, just the facts.

Break this down into the required steps. Only include the truly necessary steps.

Avoid huge refactors. Break this down into smaller steps.

After presenting your steps, provide a brief summary of the overall approach and any key considerations for the implementation process.

Remember to:

- Ensure that your plan covers all aspects of the required technical specification.
- Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Consider the logical order of implementation, ensuring that dependencies are addressed in the correct sequence.
- Include steps for error handling, data validation, and edge case management.
- Keep it concise; do not write long unnessary code snippets of existing code
