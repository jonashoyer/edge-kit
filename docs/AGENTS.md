# docs/

Project documentation and development notes.

## Structure

- `services/`: user-facing docs per service/domain
- `development/`: internal design notes and implementation writeups

## Where to look

| Topic                | File               |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Service guides       | `services/*.md`    |
| Design notes (dated) | `development/*.md` |

## Conventions

- Keep docs focused on copy-paste usage: prerequisites, minimal setup, and complete examples.
- Prefer linking to concrete source files in `src/`.
